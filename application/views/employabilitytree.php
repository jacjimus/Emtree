            Employabilitree... the sweet nectar you have cultivated with your bare hands
            and clear mind.

            Employabilitree... a network of tap roots turning gears to help you grow,
            watching as you spread your arms, branching into all the sectors of life
            that you seek.
        </p>
        <p>
            Employabilitree... where stems grow stronger, mind shifts faster,
            ideas last longer, people grow quicker
            and hence forth... get there.
        </p>
        <p>
            So water the gardens of your fertile mind, watch grow the steadfast
            dreams of your time, watch money grow from this tree, your careers ears expand
            and thrive and henceforth you become free.
        </p>
        <p>
            Free from economical saturation, free from complaints
            free from wants and needs and desires
            just what you can achieve.
        </p>
        <p>
            Self esteem will grow greener, greener than what it has ever been before
            as you capture the light of your time and photosynthesize
            yourself into the next level of where you want to be.
        </p>
        <p>
            Careers take flight.
